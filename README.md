# ArcGIS Python Tool for LiDAR Data Processing

This Python script automates the processing of LiDAR data within ArcGIS, generating key geospatial products such as Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), Digital Surface Models (DSMs), Canopy Height Models (CHMs), slope maps, and aspect maps. It utilizes ArcPy and ArcGIS Spatial Analyst extension for efficient data handling and raster calculations.

## Features

- **LAS Dataset to Raster Conversion:** Converts LAS datasets to DEMs and DSMs using binning averaging.
- **CHM Calculation:** Computes Canopy Height Models from DEMs and DSMs.
- **Slope and Aspect Calculation:** Generates slope and aspect maps based on DEMs.

## Usage

1. **Input:** Provide a LAS dataset as input.
2. **Outputs:** Specify paths for DEM, DSM, CHM, slope, and aspect maps, along with desired cell sizes.
3. **Execution:** Run the script to automate processing.

## Requirements

- ArcGIS with Spatial Analyst extension enabled.
- Python 3.x and ArcPy installed.

## Installation

Clone this repository and run the script in ArcGIS Python environment.
